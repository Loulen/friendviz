Ever wondered who you talked to the most over the years ?

## How to use
* Download your data from facebook -> settings -> your information -> download your info -> unselect all then reselect "messages"
    * Make sure it is downloaded as a json file
* unzip the folder where the repo is located
* ```pipenv install```
  * You must have pipenv installed
* ```jupyter-lab```
* execute the first notebook cell with all the functions and stuff, then the one below "BAR CHART RACE" with your options

I'll try and make a client for it to be easier
